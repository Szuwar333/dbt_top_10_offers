### Run project

To run project you can use:
    ```dbt run --select tag:main_project```

To run tests:
    ```dbt test```


### Environment Variables

All required environment variables with example values can be found in the .env_template


### Docker

The project is fully containerized with Docker. It can be launched in 4 modes, depending on the environment variable `DBT_ACTION`

- `run` - launch dbt run
- `test` - launch tests
- `report` - create elementary report and send to AWS S3
- `monitor` - send notification to slack using elementary


### Style and rules

- Models should be pluralized, for example, customers, orders, products.
- Each model should have a primary key.
- The primary key of a model should be named <object>_id, for example, account_id. This makes it easier to know what id is being referenced in downstream joined models.
- Use underscores for naming dbt models, avoid dots.
- Use the same field names across models where possible. For example, a key to the customers table should be named customer_id rather than user_id or 'id'.
- Booleans should be prefixed with is_
- Timestamp columns should be named <event>_at(for example, created_at)
- Dates should be named <event>_date. For example, created_date.
- Events dates and times should be past tense â€” created, updated, or deleted.
- Price/revenue fields should be in decimal currency (19.99 for $19.99; many app databases store prices as integers in cents). If a non-decimal currency is used, indicate this with a suffix (price_in_cents).
- Schema, table and column names should be in snake_case.
- Use a consistent ordering of data types and consider grouping and labeling columns by type, as in the example below. We prefer to use the following order: ids, strings, numerics, booleans, dates, and timestamps.


### Structure

The project is structured in sections

* staging - unprocessed data from the source, naming convention `stg_[name]`
    * devitjobs - data from devitjobs, naming convention `stg_devitjobs_[name]`
    * nofluffjobs - data from nofluffjobs, naming convention `stg_nofluffjobs_[name]`

* intermediate - data processed, naming convention `int_[name]`
    * base - data broken down by source , naming convention `int_[source]__[name]`

* marts - final data, naming convention `'mrt_[name]`
